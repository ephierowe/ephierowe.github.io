GP referrals
============

Through my time in the fitness industry I have gained oodles of experience
working with clients with medical conditions and using exercise as a form of
treatment to reduce.prevent pain, improve mobility, increase strenght, control
blood sugar levels etc.

Before starting any exercise programme clients must have a stable medical
condition that, in the opinion of your health professional, would benefit from
regular participation in physical activity.

## Medical conditions that I work with are:

- Overweight/obesity
- Stress
- Mild or moderate depression
- Mild skeletal and muscular injuries
- High blood pressure
- Type II diabetes
- Type I diabetes
- Osteoarthritis
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Osteoporosis
- Parkinson's disease
- Multiple sclerosis
- Stroke/TIA
- COPD
- Fibromyalgia
- Back problems
