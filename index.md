Ephie Rowe
==========


## Welcome

My name is Ephie and I have been working in the fitness industry for the past
seven years. Since completing my degree in Sport and Exercise Science I knew I
wanted to use exercise to help others. I am a huge believer in making fitness
and exercise accessible to all and to not put people off active living by using
muscle bound gyms and lots or mirrors.

On a personal level I have spent many years working on exercise referral schemes
in Bristol and find huge job satisfaction when people achieve things they never
thought possible. That is what I love about fitness and exercise – feeling great
after a workout and a sense of achievement when you push yourself just that
little bit further than you thought you could. I spent much of 2010 training for
numerous triathlons – the toughest of which was the London Triathlon Olympic
distance. I love the sport and setting a challenge and achieving it is the most
fantastic feeling.

Please browse my site to find out more about what services I have to offer –
from personal training to exercise classes.
